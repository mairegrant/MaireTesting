Today I am reflecting on freelance testing in QA. My experience with QA Testing is limited in part due to opportunity and being conscious of my testing responsibilities in full time employment. 

I have had the opportunity to take part in user surveys, UAT testing for Bosch and at Queen's University where I took part in testing with pizza and Amazon vouchers. I would love the opportunity to work with more brands for collaboration in the e-commerce and tech space even on a voluntary basis in order to expand my skillset. 

I am thankful for the learning opportunities these present, trying to pick up a new domain and think on my feet. Previously I had a mini twitter 'Bugs in the Wild' series where I would post about bugs I found in everyday life and not in a 'bug bounty' quest, although as a tester every day is a bug bounty quest. This series looked at some bugs in ASOS and Goodreads to name a few. 

I would like the oppotunity in my career to explore new domains having had insight to a range of different domains, this is the experience I want to ascertain, I want to become a jack-of-all-trades and yes, this comes with the 'master of none' caveat but to specialise in just one area and domain would be detrimental to feeding exploration and creativity. The intersections of my hobbies and interests has always been one of my strengths, to attune a "think outside the box" approach.
