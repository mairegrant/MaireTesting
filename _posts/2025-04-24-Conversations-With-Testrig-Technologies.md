I recently had the pleasure of connecting with Priti Gaikwad 👩🏻‍💻 🌟 on LinkedIn and have been checking out some of the test automation articles at  [Testrig Technologies: QA & Software Testing Company](https://www.testrigtechnologies.com/) 🥳 🔍

📚 I had a read through:
- Playwright for Mobile Testing the Ultimate Guide to Performance & Quality 
- Playwright Commands Every Tester Must Know for Faster Automation
- Automating Web Testing with Playwright Best Practices & Pitfalls 
- What is Big Data Testing and Its Essential Types 

There were concepts that were new to me and this highlights how important it is to be upskilling and learning as we might learn something that we can add to our testing toolkit or that will become part of a solution to a problem we approach! 🎒 ✍ 

Things I learned from these articles: 
- Use of the slow mo command in Playwright for debugging 🐞 
- Names for terms like Veracity, Variety and Velocity Testing (I was aware of the concepts but would refer to them by the concept description and not a term and using a shared term saves time!) 💐 
- More about advanced network interception on Playwright, I haven't had much hands on experience with using network interception in Playwright for mocking and simulating errors with APIs (but would like to)! ⏱️ 🛑 

Check out the articles if you are interested in all things automation - there is alot of valuable content and I look forward to reading more in future and keeping up to date! The Big Data testing article I found to be a great reference for the different types of testing to consider and I can see myself sharing this in future for reference! 💗 📰 

➡️ Side note: I watched [this video essay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=cUoe3-C2kYsyViKj&v=pQy193-CFmc&feature=youtu.be) by Cinzia DuBois / Lady of the Library on Youtube about digital hoarding of information called Why Do We Hoard Information We’ll Never Use? – Books, articles, and intellectual FOMO. 

I found it really interesting, I pin/bookmark/save so many articles to read later and it has changed the way I think about consuming media and prioritising content I have saved because I likely saved it for a reason! 

If you are like me this is your sign! ✨ Pick up one of those articles, go to your bookmarks and saved articles, videos, watchlists or podcast episodes and give them a read / watch / listen. Let me know in the comments anything you pick up or want to share! 🥰
