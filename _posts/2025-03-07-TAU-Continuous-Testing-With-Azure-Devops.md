Brushing up on Continuous Testing with Azure DevOps for testing, I found this course by Bushra Alam very clear to follow and very useful for beginners, refreshers and people of any skill level!

Topics covered include adding tests, publishing results, extracting test artifacts, project configurations, tasks groups, parallel test execution, handling failing and flaky tests and multi stage pipelines. 

You can check out the roadmap for Azure DevOps updates and improvements from Microsoft here: [Azure DevOps Roadmap](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/release-notes/features-timeline)

Some upcoming features around Azure Test Plan improvements worth keeping up to date on, excited to see how the test runs can integrate more seamlessly around Test Plans and Test Cases. 

A 'new test run experience' to include pipeline-based filtering in order to make it easier to connect test results to specific builds and artifacts is planned for 2025 Q2. Worth checking out to see what features may provide value to you and your team!
