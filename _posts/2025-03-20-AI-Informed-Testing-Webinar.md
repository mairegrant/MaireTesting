I attended the AI-Informed Testing Webinar session live with Jason Arbon & XBOSoft.

I checked in last to see some of the work Jason Arbon is doing with AI in testing in this video webinar with Philip Lew, XBOSoft and testers.ai and I did like the extension highlighting test scenarios in gherkin syntax for a given page in the browser. Always interesting to see what others are working on and new tools and technologies!  

This kind of thing is quite exciting as given a screenshot test cases are generated helping us to streamline testing, help not to miss edge cases and to identify missing requirements earlier on. We could look at doing this at the prototype level so that we are shifting left and thinking about quality being baked in as early as possible and really focusing on TDD principles early on! Excited to see what AI will bring to testing as we advance in this industry! 

Philip Lew highlighted the importance of the 80/20 pareto principle in automation and ROI with automation and increasing results with a reduction in effort in (manual) testing. I liked the graphic below - I'm sure we can all relate to the following problems as testers.
