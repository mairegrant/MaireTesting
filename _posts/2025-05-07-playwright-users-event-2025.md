I virtually attended the Playwright User's Event 2025 to keep up to date with the recent advancements in Playwright and within the automation community. It's always nice to famaliarise myself with others in the space as there is so much to learn from everyone.

It's great to hear about advancements on how AI is driving testing and assiting with our automation but I always appreciate the emphasis on the basics and the importance of exploratory testing. 

I am waiting on the recorded sessions to be rolled out via email so I can catch up on the sessions I missed.
