I virtually attended the Playwright Live Community Updates and More March event on 21st March 2025 looking at the latest community updates, new and experimental features and improvements hot off the press. 

A great session as always with Debbie O'Brien and Ben Fellows. Excited for the functionality that the new MCP server will bring for us! AI, Aria snapshots and the MCP server were covered among other topics in this session.
