As a test automation developer and a keen runner I have often thought about using my personal Strava data to create custom graphs and charts outside of those provided in the app among other intentions. This article is on getting started and setting up to query your own personal Strava data using Strava’s V3 publicly available API.

I isolated the longitude and latitude data to build a heatmap of my activites by location. I have provided some of the results below:

The full article is available on Medium and as I don't believe in paywalling knowledge - everything you can find from me will be openly available and free!

I looked at the type of activities completed on Strava, walking and running making up the most of this. I use Huawei Health which utilises the Strava WebHooks to sync my activities so would be interesting to expand on this on the hooks side of things in future.
