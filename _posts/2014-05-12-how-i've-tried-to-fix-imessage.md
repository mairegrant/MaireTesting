I've gotten many, many helpful emails and tweets with tips for how to fix my [iMessage purgatory problem](/imessage-purgatory/) (people are great). Unfortunately, I've already tried everything that people have suggested (so far, at least).

For the record, I still have my old iPhone, so I can easily swap the SIM card back into it and perform common fixes. Here are at least a few of the things I've tried:

* Reset my Apple ID password
* Turn off iMessage in the Settings app
* Log out of Messages and FaceTime on all my devices
* Text STOP to 48369
* Remove my device from My Support Profile (https://supportprofile.apple.com/)

The phone number in question is not associated with my Apple ID anymore. If I log into my Apple account in the Messages setting, that number doesn't show up as a send/receive option. But on the iDevices of my friends and family, that number still appears to be associated with iMessage.

If you've got a suggestion I haven't listed above, let me know! I've tried a lot over the past week, so I'm sure there are a couple I've forgotten about. I'm also not including terrible solutions, like "have everyone you know delete you as a contact and re-add you" or "have everyone you know delete all previous conversations with you." Incidentally, I've tried these things on Ellen's phone and she still can't send me a text.

<a name="update1"></a>[_Update_](#update1): I was able to fix the problem on a per-phone basis  by doing the following:

1. Open Settings > Messages.
2. Toggle iMessage to Off.
3. Send a text to the black-hole number. (It should send as SMS.)
4. Turn iMessage back on in Settings > Messages.

Of course, the only phone I have access to is Ellen's, and I'm not about to ask all of my contacts to do this. At least now Ellen can text me, but that's nothing close to a solution.

(I'll try to update this with any new fixes worth mentioning &mdash; and hopefully, eventually, one that works.)
