I'm MÃ¡ire Grant, a passionate test automation engineer and techie. Besides all things automata and code I love to travel, paint, run and hike. I am based outside of Belfast. 
You can find some of my stuff around the internet but this is an attempt to collate everything into one directory. I've written some [Medium](https://medium.com/@mairegrant) articles and Blog posts. I love creative endevours at the bridge between my hobbies - like FashTech where I previously created a light up skirt or made my own programming language croc jibbitz after a lack thereof to buy online. 

I've worked in several different environments from start up, scale up and corportate. From local firms to international household names such as the Duth powerhouse Philips. I've worked across different domains such as sports, education, private and public sector, finance, health and life sciences and insurance.
