My name is Adam Olin Pash. I grew up in [a small town in Iowa](http://www.cityofharlan.com/), went to school in Iowa City, lived in Los Angeles, CA for eight years, and currently live in Brooklyn, NY.

I've done a lot of things on the internet, but if you've heard of any of them, it's probably [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com), which I initially wrote for (2005-2008) and then ran (2009-2012). I've also written for a number of other publications, like Wired, Popular Science, and PC World, and I've written [a couple of books](http://www.amazon.com/Adam-Pash/e/B001JRYOY6/).

Above all else, I love building things. I'm currently building things with code, focusing on tools that streamline the way you do things. Here's a [non-comprehensive list of projects](/projects) I've built in the the past, but I'm always hacking on something new.

I've worked for myself, in corporate environments, and in startups. I recently completed a three-month fellowship at [Hacker School](https://www.hackerschool.com/), a writers' retreat for programmers, where I focused on machine learning and multimedia projects.

You can follow me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/adampash) or check me out [on GitHub](https://github.com/adampash/). You can email me at \[first.last\] at gmail.com and I'll get back to you asap.
